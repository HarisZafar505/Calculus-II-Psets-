# Problem Sets â€“ Calculus II TA

This repository contains problem sets I prepared while TA'ing Calculus and Analytical Geometry- II, offered at the Department of Physics, QAU, Islamabad during Spring 2025.

## Course Topics

The course covered key topics in single-variable calculus beyond the basics, including:

- Techniques of Integration
- Infinite Series and Convergence
- Conic Sections
- Polar Coordinates and Parametric Equations

## About the Problem Sets

These problem sets were created to supplement the course material and provide practice to students. Some questions were inspired by standard textbooks, while others were custom-designed to reinforce conceptual understanding and computational fluency.

Solutions (where included) are intended as guides and may reflect one possible approach.
